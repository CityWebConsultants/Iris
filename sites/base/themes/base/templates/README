This templates folder is where you can store template files, which override those that are included with the modules.

Custom templates are loaded to override the base module template by their filename.

Examples for entities:
----------------------

Naming a template after an entity - e.g. page.html for an entity called 'page' - will cause it to be used as the inner template
for that entity type when it is rendered.

If one would like to target a specific entity by its ID to use a different template, this is done by naming the template along the
format <entity>_<entity ID>.html, e.g. page_3.html for the 'page' entity with an ID of 3.

Examples from core modules:
---------------------------

html.html           - Main wrapper template
maintenance.html    - Maintenance mode page
restart.html        - Restarting page
startup.html        - "Starting up" page
404.html            - 404 page
