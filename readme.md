# Iris

Iris is a modular content management system and web application framework built using Node.js and MongoDB. 

## Key features

* Graphical admin interface
* Permission and role system
* Extensible module and theme system
* Built using a Hook API system that allows overriding and jumping on system functions
* Entity, entity type and field system (all built through an admin UI)
* Block, region, theme and embed system
* Simultanious serverside and client side rendering so you can use React, Angular or whatever client side framework you want while falling back to a JavaScript disabled version for SEO and progressive enhancement.
* Web socket (Socket.io) messaging and session support built in, including automatic live updating of content.
* A quick to write and embed form system based on JSON schema 
* An actions module for registering events, conditions and actions to fire at certain times
* A logs page for viewing messages and errors
* Database entity queries done through simple widgets placed in HTML that handle all access permissions for you.
* Iris was built with version control in mind with congiguration stored in easily exportable/importable JSON files. You can even view difs and export/import config through the UI.
* Iris was built on Windows, Linux and Mac OS so should work on all three.
