# Iris

Iris is a modular content management system and web application framework built using JavaScript and MongoDB. It comes with a user, role and permission system, a flexible theme, block, field and entity system and an administrative UI so you can get started without writing any JavaScript or dive deep into it by using its hook system to build custom modules.

Iris comes with its own form system, powered by simple JSON form schema and one line widgets for fetching, filtering and sotritng entities (pages for example) that not only handle all the database queries and access permissions for you but can automatically live update without page refresh so you can use them for news feeds, social media websites and chat rooms. Without writing any server side code.

Iris comes with an extendable user, profile, role and permission system with a graphical admin interface so you can make sure only people with the right permissions can access content you want or perform actions.

Although we'd love you to build and share custom modules, and provide a full hook based API for doing so (meaning you can override or extend anything you'd want to override), a lot of Iris is built to be used without writing masses of extra JavaScript. The admin interface will allow you to build up blocks, regions, users, views/lists of content, make custom content types, attach fields to them and create, edit and delete content all through a graphical user interface.

Iris was built with version control in mind so, instead of storing blocks, regions, fields and entity types, views and other configuration in the database, all configuration you'd want to put through Git or another version control system is stored in easily exportable/importable JSON files. You can see if and what has changed through the graphical interface. You can even edit these configuration files manually if you want as they're written to be human-readable. The exporting and importing is again done through the user interface, though if you prefer drag and drop exporting and importing you can do that too and nothing will break.

After a year of keeping it to ourselves, we'd love you to try out Iris, let us know what we've done right and wrong and help us build it by contributing to its source code and building modules.
